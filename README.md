LEAF ME ALONE is a 2 player VS game that is heavily themed around the concept of raking the leaves (BECAUSE IT IS FALL)
You will become a player who would want to rake more leaves to your neighbors house, so that person who put more leaves on your opponent's side by the end of timer wins 
There are several means to achieve this.
You can bother your opponent from raking the leaves out (Such as throwing Leaf bag, "BUMPING" on to your neighbor, Blowing your neighbor with wind blower, Or even just hitting your opponent with a rake (I know you guys all wanted to do it at some point))
OR you can just try to rake your leaves out. The choices are yours! 

May the one with less leaves prevail this Fall!

Prerequisite : To play this game you need two Xbox controller, and two human (Or you can try playing it with one hand each but I don't recommend)
